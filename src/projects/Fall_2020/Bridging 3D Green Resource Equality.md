## &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Project Overview

<br />

Between 2010 and 2017, population has increased in neighborhoods across all five boroughs of NYC, but decreased in Chinatown area. 

Chinatown residents identified housing as the major issue they care most about as they live in the less affluent area.

Neighborhoods with high-rise buildings are usually lack of outdoor green spaces provided for every residents due to a dense residential population. 

Yet, green spaces are essential for people’s health and can be achieved through multiple methods. 

### Problem Statement

Extreme environmental and health issues are shifting real estate values towards greater access to open spaces over transits in NYC.
How will Chinatown act to maximize accessibility to green spaces for low-income residents affected by city-wide gentrification?

```
“What if increasing the population of Chinatown through a high FAR neighborhood 

with enlarged preferable outdoor spaces through varied add-on green systems？ ”
```

*Equally distributed green space.*

*Chinatown with design space.*


### Goals and Metrics

#### 1. Walkability
Distance to green spaces including ground travel distance and vertical travel distance from each floor. 

#### 2. Daylight Hours
Daylight hours of green spaces from April to Octorber that have at least 6-hour daylight.

*Measuring at the height of trees (12 meters above the ground).*

#### 3. Green Space Area per person 
Sqft of net green spaces of all types divided by population.

### Why?

Short distance to green spaces can scatter the population and create equal green resource accessibility for each individual person.
Daylight hours are necessary and beneficial for vegetation and preferable green spaces.

*Vegetation suitable for NYC Climate.*


### What Did We Discover?

```
“Through the computational design model, we have identified:

terraces with vertical forests, courtyards with green gardens, and bridges with public green spaces 

that allows the neighborhood to address high density while achieving desirable green spaces for each person.”

### Design Space

```
"FAR varies because we want a combination of different procedural types and green space types."
```

### Conclusions and Next Steps

1. If applying this model as a proof-of-concept across city, the next step we recommend is to understand the zoning requirement for each neighborhood.
*FAR as input is important. Bridging System also needs to apply in areas that are programatically suitable.*
2. Whether to apply this model in a neighborhood requires a fundamental understanding of its social-economical and cultural context. 
Bias may exist without a comprehensive preliminary research of the site.

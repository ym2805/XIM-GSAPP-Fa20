### Description: 1-3 Sentences of What the Type is

This is a basic description of the type that is simple enough that anyone can understand that explains what it does and why someone would use it. Keep it to 3 sentences or less.

### Required inputs 

Required inputs: Ex, Lots, FAR/ Density, attractor geometry, etc. Dynamic vs static. Dynamic: Lots and FAR. Static: Floor to Floor Height

### Type Rules 

1. 1 to 3 sentences describing the procedural rules 
1. Add image that shows the range of variability for the type. Try to make it explanatory of what rules are, not just what the output looks like.

Add image here to further illustrate your point.

### Use Type If: 

1. Why? Short description of why you would use this type, likely related to performance, goals or program type. Could be structure as a series of bullet points preceded by, "Use this type if you want to . . ."

### Not Recommended to Use Type If:

1. Why not? Similar to above but covering instances when this type is not appropriate. While it might work on odd lot geometry it might not produce the result you would want.
1. This tool does X it does not do Z and Y.

### What to Know & Limitations 

1. Ex, Courtyard offset in cluster. Vertical Courtyard has trimmed surfaces. 
1. Either technical (for example, if it doesn't handle certain geometry,) or based on the how it was constructed. For the type used in the example, the scale 1d at the end to match the target area means that the vertical courtyard may not maintain the minimum size for the courtyard. The courtyard depth is currently suitable for single loaded corridor residential or side loaded office.
1. Add any common problems that could go wrong
